# An Experimental Operator Framework for the Riemann Hypothesis (QVM)

## Overview

This document introduces a structured experimental framework for evaluating
operator-based approaches to the Riemann Hypothesis.

It does not attempt to prove RH. Instead, it defines how candidate operators
are tested, falsified, compared, and documented in a reproducible manner.

---

## Motivation

Many operator proposals fail due to:

- ad hoc numerical experiments
- uncertified zero data
- undocumented failure modes
- lack of reproducibility

This framework addresses these issues systematically.

---

## Framework Components

- Certified zeta zero datasets
- Explicit formula diagnostics
- Operator admissibility criteria
- Multi-dimensional evaluation metrics
- Stability and refinement testing

---

## Role of the SMRK Hamiltonian

The SMRK Hamiltonian is treated strictly as a test case:

- not privileged
- not assumed correct
- evaluated under the same criteria as any other operator

---

## Methodological Principle

Numerical agreement is not evidence of correctness.
Falsification and stability are primary objectives.

---

## Status

- Complete experimental methodology
- Fully reproducible
- Extensible to other operators and L-functions
- Not a proof of RH

---

## Importance

This document provides the methodological backbone of the entire SMRK/QFC effort.
